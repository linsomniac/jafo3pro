# Jafo 3 Pro

An Ender 3 Pro upgraded with:

- SKR Mini E3 V2.0
- Creality Sprite Hotend/Extruder
- CR-Touch
- X and Y steppers upgraded with "Usongshine Nema 17 Stepper Motor 42BYGH 1.8 Degree 38MM 1.5A 42 Motor (17HS4401S)"

This repo includes a Klipper config for this printer.

## Why

It was mostly about wanting to get auto bed leveling on the Ender 3 Pro.

My steppers had started losing steps, and I couldn't find any issues in
the X/Y travel or belts, and the steppers were already at a reasonable
voltage, and were running warm, so I replaced them and the level shifting
stopped.
